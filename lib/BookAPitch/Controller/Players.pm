BookAPitch::Controller::Players - Catalyst Controller

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Catalyst Controller.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 base

Can place common logic to start chained dispatch here

=cut
sub base :Chained('/') :PathPart('players') :CaptureArgs(0) {
    my ($self, $c) = @_;

    # Store the ResultSet in stash so it's available for other methods
    $c->stash(resultset => $c->model('BookAPitchDB::User'));

    # Print a message to the debug log
    $c->log->debug('*** INSIDE BASE METHOD ***');
}

=head2 object

Fetch the specified player object based on the player ID and store
it in the stash

=cut

sub object :Chained('base') :PathPart('id') :CaptureArgs(1) {
    # $id = primary key of player to delete
    my ($self, $c, $id) = @_;

    # Find the book object and store it in the stash
    $c->stash(object => $c->stash->{resultset}->find($id));

    # Make sure the lookup was successful.  You would probably
    # want to do something like this in a real app:
    #   $c->detach('/error_404') if !$c->stash->{object};
    die "Player $id not found!" if !$c->stash->{object};

    # Print a message to the debug log
    $c->log->debug("*** INSIDE OBJECT METHOD for obj id=$id ***");
}


=head2 register
